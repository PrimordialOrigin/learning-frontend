            What is Frontend Mentor, and how will it help me?

            developers improve their frontend coding skills with projects in
            HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's suitable for all levels and ideal for

        <div class="question-answer two">
          <span class="question"> Is frontend Mentor free? </span>
          <span class="answer">
            The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some that
            are premium and require a Pro subscription to access. It will say on
            each challenge whether they are free or premium, so it's easy to
            tell the difference.

            Can I use FrontEnd Mentor projects for my portfolio?
          </span>
          <span class="answer">
            Definitely! Please do feel free to use whatever you build in your
            portfolio. Helping developers add professional-looking projects to
            their portfolio was one of the reasons we created this platform!

          <span class="question">
            How can I get help if I'm stuck on a challenge?
          </span>
          <span class="answer">
            The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our
            Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in there, so
            it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated "help"
            channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite to our
            Discord server here.
